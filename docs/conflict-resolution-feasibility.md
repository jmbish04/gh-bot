# Automated Merge Conflict Resolution Feasibility

This document captures the current assessment of building an automated merge-conflict resolution workflow on top of the `gh-bot` Cloudflare Worker.

## Existing Building Blocks

The Worker already ships with the core infrastructure that the feature would rely on:

- **Webhook System** – GitHub events (pull request comments, reviews, labels) are ingested today.
- **Durable Objects** – The `PrWorkflow` object provides PR-scoped state that can drive long-running merge tasks.
- **D1 Database** – Serves as persistent storage for tracking progress and outcomes of conflict-resolution attempts.
- **Workers AI** – LLM inference is integrated, enabling conflict analysis and suggestion generation.
- **MCP Infrastructure** – A GitHub Copilot workspace is embedded for tool composition.
- **GitHub API Integration** – `src/lib/github.ts` already handles authentication and API calls.
- **Operation Logging** – `src/lib/operation_logger.ts` records long-running operations.

With these pieces, the system already covers authentication, webhook handling, stateful coordination, and async task tracking.

## Feasibility Summary

The feature is **feasible and recommended** when approached incrementally.

### Fully Feasible

- Clone repositories and manage branches inside the Cloudflare Sandbox SDK.
- Detect merge conflicts with `git fetch` + `git merge` and parse conflicts with `git diff`.
- Use Workers AI to analyze conflict regions and propose resolutions.
- Meet performance expectations (100–300 ms cold starts, sub-10 ms warm starts, and 10–50 ms edge latency).

### Feasible With Caveats

- **Authentication & Permissions** – Provide the GitHub App token through Workers Secrets and ensure the app has `contents:write` and `pull_requests:write` scopes.
- **Comment Triggers** – Extend the webhook handler to recognize commands such as `@colby/please fix code conflicts`, while preventing bot-comment loops and posting progress updates.
- **Real-Time Feedback** – Stream sandbox output to logs; publish user-visible updates either by editing a PR comment or through the GitHub Checks API.

### Not Recommended For Full Automation

- Automatically committing complex conflict resolutions: human approval should remain in the loop, with AI suggestions treated as recommendations.
- Handling extremely large monorepos or heavily refactored conflicts, which may exceed sandbox resource limits or require domain knowledge.

## Implementation Roadmap

1. **Phase 1 – MVP (1–2 weeks)**
   - Parse PR comments for `@colby/please fix code conflicts`.
   - Launch a sandbox task to clone the repository, check out the PR branch, and attempt a merge with the base branch.
   - Extract conflict regions, summarize them, and request AI-generated suggestions.
   - Post a comment with the proposal and store the operation in D1.

2. **Phase 2 – Interactive Workflow (2–3 weeks)**
   - Allow maintainers to approve an AI suggestion via reactions.
   - Upon approval, commit and push the resolution, with rollback support.
   - Extend scenarios to cherry-pick, rebase, and squash workflows.

3. **Phase 3 – Advanced Enhancements (3–4 weeks)**
   - Capture successful resolutions to inform future suggestions.
   - Train predictive strategies for recurring conflict patterns.
   - Support repository-specific resolution templates and integrate with preference learning modules.

## Implementation Considerations

- **Sandbox Execution** – Use `getSandbox` to run git commands, parse conflicts, and run Workers AI prompts.
- **Database Schema** – Introduce a `merge_operations` table (operation status, conflict metadata, approvals, resulting commit).
- **Security** – Scope GitHub tokens appropriately, validate requester permissions, and rate-limit commands.

## Recommendation

Start with the MVP path: detect conflicts, provide AI-authored suggestions, and rely on human approval before pushing changes. This approach builds on the current architecture, keeps computation inside Cloudflare, and minimizes security risk while delivering immediate user value.
