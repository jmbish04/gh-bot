/**
 * Research Orchestration Workflow
 * 
 * TODO: Create a Cloudflare Workflow that orchestrates the agentic research process
 * 
 * 1. Define the workflow class extending WorkflowEntrypoint:
 *    ```typescript
 *    export class ResearchOrchestrationWorkflow extends WorkflowEntrypoint {
 *      async run(event: WorkflowEvent, step: WorkflowStep) {
 *        // Workflow implementation
 *      }
 *    }
 *    ```
 * 
 * 2. Implement workflow steps:
 *    - Step 1: Initialize research context
 *    - Step 2: Trigger GitHub search via Queue
 *    - Step 3: Process search results with AI agents
 *    - Step 4: Generate research summary
 *    - Step 5: Store results in D1 database
 *    - Step 6: Send notification email
 * 
 * 3. Add error handling and retry logic:
 *    - Use step.do() for automatic retries
 *    - Implement compensation logic for failed steps
 * 
 * 4. Export the workflow for registration in wrangler.toml:
 *    ```toml
 *    [[workflows]]
 *    name = "research-orchestration"
 *    class_name = "ResearchOrchestrationWorkflow"
 *    ```
 * 
 * Note: Leverage Workflows for durable execution and automatic state management
